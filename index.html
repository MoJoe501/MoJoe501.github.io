    <h2>Software / Games Developer</h2>
	<p>I'm me. Webpage is a work in progress.</p>
    
    <h2>My University Work</h2>
    
    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>All this pages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. GitHub Pages does not have functionality for PHP but I have used it before.</p>
    
    <h3>Games</h3>
    
    <h4>Tumble Town</h4>
    <p>My introduction to games development while in a group. <br/>Created with Unity Engine using C#.</p>

    <h4>Mario Mini</h4>
    <p>Finding out how small the original 'Super Mario Bros.' I set out to see how small I could remake the game. I knew I never would get close since the game was only 32 kilobytes with high optimizations for the console it was originally released on but I wanted to learn some optimization techniques that are/were used for video games to run them smoothly within a small storage capacity.</p>

    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    
    <h3>Portal's Portals</h3>
    <p>Curiosity killed the cat as they say. Making a portal project an image on a 2D surface to show depth no matter where the player is standing is slightly tougher than I thought.</p>
    
    <h3>Discord Bully Bot</h3>
    <p>Did you ever want to be bullied by Gregory House from House M.D.&trade;? Well now apparently you can. Made a silly bot that kicks you out of voice after a random amount of time. </p>
    <p>Also extended the use to create other commands which allow any user in a server such as saving text/images to be used at a later time like an emoji or meme. The bot can now also play youtube and mp3 songs. Queueing is a work in progress tho.</p>
    
    <h3>Project: Cannon-G</h3>
